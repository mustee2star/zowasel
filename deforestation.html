      <p>
        Zowasel is committed to transforming agriculture from a carbon source to a carbon sink through its Vision 2035 Value Chain Transformation Strategy: Transforming value chains through sustainable agriculture across communities, people, and the planet.
      </p>
      <p>
        Deforestation and land conversion are primarily driven by crop production, which is a key contributor to the current ecological and climate crises that we are all facing.

    <!-- EU Regulation Section -->
    <section class="mb-5">
      <h3 class="">EU Deforestation-free Regulation</h3>
      <p>
        The fight against deforestation is intensifying. The new European Union’s Deforestation-free Regulation (EUDR) compels companies placing products on the EU market to prove the provenance and journey of their commodities to prevent imports from recently deforested land or imports that have contributed to forest degradation.
      </p>
      <p>
        The EU rules require robust digital solutions to trace products from producer to consumer. Forest ecosystems are the most significant terrestrial carbon sink, storing approximately 400 gigatons. 23% of total anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions (2007-2016) come from agriculture, forestry, and other land uses. About 11% of emissions are from deforestation and conversion of natural ecosystems.
      </p>
    </section>

    <!-- Climate Impact Section -->
    <section class="mb-5">
      <h3 class="">Climate Impact and Solutions</h3>
      <p>
        Tropical primary forests, in particular, are critical for carbon storage. Biodiversity loss in 2021 resulted in 2.5 Gt of carbon dioxide emissions, equivalent to India's annual fossil fuel emissions.
      </p>
      <p>
        Halting deforestation and maintaining forests could prevent the emission of 3.6 +/—2 Gt of carbon dioxide equivalent per year between 2020 and 2050, about 14% of what is needed to keep planetary warming below 1.5°C by 2030. According to the United Nations' Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), global food systems are responsible for about 17 billion metric tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent, or 26% of annual emissions.

          These guidelines support the <strong>People & Nature Policy</strong>, referencing requirements and expectations for emerging farmers, cooperatives, and smallholder farmers. Implementation of this Policy is carried out and verified in stages, with progress regularly tracked and communicated by Zowasel through written updates or targets.
        </p>
        <p>
          For sourcing from the Crop Pilot, the Policy's implementation is immediate and subject to these guidelines and the Marketplace timeframe.
        </p>

          <strong>Policy Scope:</strong>  
          <ul>
            <li>Geographic Scope: Global</li>
            <li>Cash Crops and Grains: Covers commodities such as cocoa, palm oil, cashew, soybean, tea, coffee, and grains like wheat, barley, corn, and sorghum.</li>
            <li>Future Expansion: The Policy may expand based on risk assessments of commodities associated with ecosystem conversion.</li>
          </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Legal Recognition:</strong>  
          Where discrepancies exist between voluntary commitments, applicable law, and internationally recognized human rights, the highest standard is used for compliance.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Cut-off Dates:</strong>  
          A cut-off date of 31 December 2024 has been applied to ensure no further deforestation or ecosystem conversion in Zowasel's supply chain.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Purpose of the Scheme Rules:</strong>  
          To meet the EUDR requirements, Zowasel has developed commodity-specific protocols for protecting ecosystems from deforestation and conversion.

        <p>Zowasel Crop Pilot is an independent service provider and offers measuring, reporting, and verification for emissions reporting and compliance with the EUDR Due Diligence Statement (DDS). A comprehensive AI and remote sensing DNV digital portal will offer real-time data transmission through (API) for internal reporting systems.</p>
        <p>We will regularly update our assessment of where risks of deforestation and land conversion exist within our supply chains, including when we start sourcing from a new country and when suppliers provide updated information on the production location of our commodities. We are also progressing on our supply chain traceability, including deploying farm-level traceability tools for our smallholder supply chain in Africa.</p>
        <p>Without complete supply chain traceability, we will continue to use an approach that combines our internal procurement intelligence with probability-based sourcing models to estimate our national and subnational sourcing regions. We will then combine these with deforestation and habitat loss datasets.</p>
        <p>We will provide updates on the progress we have made with our deforestation and conversion-free commitment within our external sustainability disclosures, including our ESG Reporting Index, which is published annually.</p>

        <p>Whenever affected crops are made available, traders must ensure that the relevant information is passed on as part of the DDS. When processing relevant products, such as beans, into oil, a new DDS creates the information from all previous DDSs. It enables farmers to declare all their fields, regardless of whether the crop was grown on them in the first year (the so-called “Declaration in Excess”). In subsequent years, the relevant fields can be selected and no longer need to be entered into the EUDR information system.</p>

        <h2>Self-assessment</h2>
        <p>The (direct) supplier completes the self-assessment before the initial verification assessment. The purpose of the self-assessments is to evaluate the (direct) supplier’s level of readiness for the independent verification assessment.</p>
        <p>The independent verification body evaluates the self-assessment within 14 calendar days of submission. The verification body decides if a (direct) supplier is sufficiently prepared to undergo the verification assessment. The initial verification assessment is planned when the supplier is considered adequately prepared.</p>

        <h2>Requirements for Smallholder Farmers</h2>
        <p>We guide and train smallholders and cooperatives to comply with all relevant legislation across our operating markets. For African smallholder farmers aiming to sell their crops to the EU markets or through medium and large traders, the geolocation data of their fields must be collected and shared so that the initial marketer in the EU has all the information for the due diligence declaration. From 30.12.2025, the geodata for the 2025 harvest must be available for imports by medium and large companies.</p>
        <p>Farm mapping, which involves collecting polygon coordinates to establish the exact location and size of the farms, the number of cocoa trees, and socioeconomic and household data, formed the basis for meeting ERUDR requirements.</p>
        <p>The benefit involves the opportunity to outline the boundaries of the farms through polygon mapping to establish their proximity to forests and potential risks of expansion into protected areas. Combining this information with additional data on the farmer, their family, and the community gives a solid picture of what specific farms need to transition to sustainable agricultural practices.</p>
        <p>These datasets are a cornerstone in developing robust risk assessments for environmental and human rights abuses in compliance with upcoming due diligence legislation, thus advancing efforts to tackle the main sustainability challenges in the cocoa sector.</p>

      <h2>Measuring, Reporting, and Verification</h2>
      <p>Zowasel Crop Pilot is an independent service provider and offers measuring, reporting, and verification for emissions reporting and compliance with the EUDR Due Diligence Statement (DDS). A comprehensive AI and remote sensing DNV digital portal will offer real-time data transmission through (API) for internal reporting systems.</p>
      <p>We will regularly update our assessment of where risks of deforestation and land conversion exist within our supply chains, including when we start sourcing from a new country and when suppliers provide updated information on the production location of our commodities. We are also progressing on our supply chain traceability, including deploying farm-level traceability tools for our smallholder supply chain in Africa.</p>
      <p>Without complete supply chain traceability, we will continue to use an approach that combines our internal procurement intelligence with probability-based sourcing models to estimate our national and subnational sourcing regions. We will then combine these with deforestation and habitat loss datasets.</p>
      <p>We will provide updates on the progress we have made with our deforestation and conversion-free commitment within our external sustainability disclosures, including our ESG Reporting Index, which is published annually.</p>

      <h2>EUDR Compliance Training Facilitation</h2>
      <p>As a significant value chain stakeholder, your support for building the knowledge base and capacity of cooperatives and their farmers on EUDR regulatory requirements is desperately needed to navigate the new rules, continue participating in international trade, and safeguard the livelihoods of millions of smallholders.</p>
      <p>Despite the availability of Zowasel's innovative solutions for implementing the EUDR requirements across the agricultural last mile, the cost of rolling them out can impede the adoption of these solutions by farmer cooperatives, local agents, and small agribusinesses.</p>
      <p>These costs go beyond software and equipment acquisition (e.g., mobile devices and software licenses). Compared to the substantial investment required for capacity building and human resource training for smallholders and extension agents across clusters and regions, they are marginal.</p>
      <p>Hiring and training staff such as cooperative clerks, extension officers, and agents represents the highest investment for value chain actors. Targeted action is imperative to ensure that field coaches, local agents, extension officers, and the smallholders they source from are included.</p>
      <p>As a result of these compliance costs, corporations must consider investing in driving compliance with EUDR and capacitate agricultural extension officers to support farmers and small commodity traders with the transition to avoid scale-back purchases from smallholder farmers in Africa due to their inability to comply with EUDR’s traceability requirements fully.</p>
