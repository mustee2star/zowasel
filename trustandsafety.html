          <p>Zowasel typically makes payment within 48 to 72 hours after the delivery confirmation by buyers.</p>
          <p>To protect our sellers and buyers, plus ourselves, we follow the normal buyers' payment terms by making payments after delivery within 48 to 72 hours.</p>
          <p>However, some buyers' typical payment terms are up to 30 to 60 days. Hence, sellers will be informed if payment will exceed the normal term, as stated, before supply.</p>
          <p>Sellers are advised of every buyer's payment terms before offer acceptance and commodity shipment. Whatever the term, payment is guaranteed for every successful transaction on the Zowasel platform!</p>

          <p>Buyers oversee offloading processes and provide sellers with warehouse results at no cost. Sellers are not responsible for paying to offload their trucks at the buyer's warehouse. After conducting a quality check, buyers oversee offloading processes and provide sellers with warehouse results at no cost.</p>

          <p>To protect buyers and sellers, and ourselves, we follow the normal buyers' payment terms by making payments only after delivery.</p>
          <p>We make payment after delivery confirmation or hold a reserve for a simple reason: we want to protect ourselves, the seller, and the buyer if the invoice is not paid in full or delivery is not made.</p>
          <p>There are many reasons why invoices are not paid in full, including Order errors, Breakage (i.e., not all crops were delivered in good condition), delivery errors, quantity and quality errors, etc.).</p>
          <p>By not paying for the invoice in full receivables, we protect ourselves and our customers. Bear in mind that Zowasel does hold the payment in an escrow account. We will release the payment as soon as the buyer confirms the waybill received.</p>
